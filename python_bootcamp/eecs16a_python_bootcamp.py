        Welcome to your first lab for 16A! Before we dive into the content of this lab, we want to make sure that all necessary packages are installed correctly. 

        Click on the block of code below (don't worry about what it does - we'll start covering that next lab) and press the Run button (the little play button) above to run it. Alternately, you can use `Shift + Enter` to execute and move to the next block, or `Control/Command + Enter` to execute and stay in the same block. 

        If anything strange appears (most likely a jumbled mass of text that is an error message) call over your lab TA or one of your lab assistants and they should be able to help! **<span style="color:red"> Warnings are fine, don't worry about those.</span>**

        # Overview

        This mini-lab serves as an introduction to Marimo, Python and a couple important packages we will be using throughout the semester. The lab aims to teach you proper usage of certain commands and can serve as a reference doc in the future. Even if you are a Python wizard already, we recommend that you at least look through the lab and try a few of the later problems to get re-acquainted with the functions we will be frequently using in this course.

        This lab is separated into two main parts: Guide and Questions. The Guide portion walks you through frequently used Python code, functions, and techniques. The Guide is supplemented with numerous blocks of example code to showcase concepts. The Questions portion of the lab is a collection of 10 problems meant to test your understanding of this guide. If you can answer these questions, then you have the knowledge to complete any and all programming tasks in EECS 16A.

        ## List Comprehension

        There are multiple ways of creating lists in Python. If you recall from the first discussion, a list is a mutable array of data. They can be created using square brackets [ ]. Elements in a list are separated by commas. Elements can be of any type (int, string, float, etc.).

        Important Python List functions: 

        - `'+'` joins lists and creates a *new* list. 

        - `len(x)` to get the length of list `x`


        Next, we will explore the idea of list comprehension, which is a compact way of creating a list from a for-loop in a single line. Please keep in mind that list comprehension is just a style suggestion; any list comprehension can be expanded to a fully fleshed out control-loop block. However, the advantage of list comprehensions is their compact yet expressive syntax.


        **For the example below, our goal is to create a list of the squares of each even integer in the range from 0 to 10 (inclusive).**

        ### Pronounced NumPIE

        From the NumPy website, "NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things: a powerful N-dimensional array object." For the purposes of this course, we primarily use NumPy for its fast and fancy matrix functions. In general, Python list operations are slow; NumPy functions exploit the NumPy array object to "vectorize" the code, which usually improves the runtime of matrix calculations. **As a general rule of thumb, if a task involves vectors or matrices, you should resort to NumPy.** In addition to speeding up basic operations, NumPy contains an enormous library of matrix functions, so if you ever need to manipulate a vector or matrix, NumPy most likely already has a function implemented to suit your needs.

        ## Creating a NumPy array object

        NumPy is centered around the `numpy.array()` class. This array object is extremely useful, however, it is often confused with built-in Python lists, particularly when trying to represent vectors.

        If you are not familiar with Python lists, a list is a sequence of numbers, like `1,2,3,4`, stored together. You may also see the term tuple used in notebooks and in the NumPy library. You can think of a tuple as a Python list that you cannot modify.

        A NumPy array is similar to a Python list in the sense that it also stores multiple numbers, but, as you will see later, NumPy arrays and Python Lists are NOT synonymous; you **cannot** simply apply functions to NumPy arrays as if they were Python Lists.

        ## NumPy array slicing

        Array slicing is a technique in Python (and other languages) that programmers use to extract specific index-based information from an array. Array slicing answers queries such as, "What are the first/last n elements in this array?", "What are the elements in the first r rows and first c columns of this matrix?", "What is every nth element in this array?"

        **Zero indexing:** Python uses zero indexing. This means that all arrays/lists in Python start with 0 as the index of the first element. For example, in a list `lst = [a, b, c]`, the element at index 0 `lst[0]` is `a`, and the element at index 1 `lst[1]` is `b`. Similarly, `c` would be at index 2.

        ## Checkoff
        To receive credit, all labs will require the submission of a checkoff Google form. This link will be at the bottom of each lab. If you worked with a partner, both partners should fill out the form (you should have one submission per person), and feel free to use the same Google account/computer to fill it out as long as you have the correct names and student IDs.
        If you completed the lab online, you must come to Cory 111 at a lab station first before filling out this form. Please do not fill out this form when you are not in the lab.
